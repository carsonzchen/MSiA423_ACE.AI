## Project Charter 

**Vision**: To make reasonable, reliable, and fun predictions for any real or hypothetical match-ups between two ATP players

**Mission**: Enable users to select two ATP players for the singles match-up, and to input additional optional match parameters such as surface, type and stage of tournament etc., and get a prediction of how the match will go. The prediction is based on a supervised machine learning model built and validated upon historical matches.

**Success criteria**:

* Model performance: 75% cross-validated classification accuracy on the pre-trained data *
* Business metrics: 30% users enter more than 1 pair of players, 10% recurrent users in a month *

This project structure was partially influenced by the [Cookiecutter Data Science project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

## Documentation
 
* Open up `docs/build/html/index.html` to see Sphinx documentation docs. 
* See `docs/README.md` for keeping docs up to date with additions to the repository.

## Running the application 
### 1. Set up environment 

The `requirements.txt` file contains the packages required to run the model code. An environment can be set up in two ways. See bottom of README for exploratory data analysis environment setup. 

#### With `virtualenv`

```bash
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv pennylane

source pennylane/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
#### With `conda`

```bash
conda create -n pennylane python=3.7
conda activate pennylane
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
PORT = 3002  # What port to expose app on 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////tmp/tracks.db'  # URI for database that contains tracks

```

The configuration currently says to save the database to a temporary location as it is just for testing. However, if you are not on your local machine, you may have issues with this location and should change it to a location within your home directory, where you have full permissions. To change it to saving in the data directory within this repository, run the Python code from this directory and change the `config.py` to say:

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///../data/tracksB.db'
```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from `src/add_songs.py`). 

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`:

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////Users/chloemawer/repos/MSIA423-example-project-repo-2019/data/tracks.db'
```

### 3. Initialize the database 

To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` with one initial song, run: 

`python run.py create --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

To add additional songs:

`python run.py ingest --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`


### 4. Run the application 
 
 ```bash
 python app.py 
 ```

### 5. Interact with the application 

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/]( http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to interact with the current version of hte app. 

## Testing 

Run `pytest` from the command line in the main project repository. 


Tests exist in `test/test_helpers.py`
